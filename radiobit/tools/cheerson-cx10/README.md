Cheerson CX-10 hijacking firmware
=================================

You need to wire your BBC Micro:Bit to a real remote controller as described in the presentation.
Make sure to unsolder the original SoC to get it working.

Program your BBC Micro:Bit with this python code and enjoy :)

Please note this hack may not work on some versions of Cheerson CX-10 (like the green one), but it is
mostly due to the default center values of the joysticks used.

If you manage to get it working with other CX-10 versions, feel free to make a PR !
