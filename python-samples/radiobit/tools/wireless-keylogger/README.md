Wireless Keylogger for MS Wireless 800 Keyboard
===============================================

Simply program your Micro:Bit with this python program, and you're good to go.

Your Micro:Bit will show a little animation while searching for a compatible keyboard, and a smiley when one found.
Then it will log everything in its memory.

To extract the logged keystrokes, connect your Micro:Bit to your computer with a USB cable, launch *minicom* and press any button on the Micro:Bit. The data will be sent and then flushed. Reset your Micro:Bit and you can give it another run ;)
